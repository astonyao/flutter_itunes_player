## Time spent
6 hours

## Improvements
Due to time constraint, I didn't have as many tests as I like to have. Here is a list of things I would improve/test if I had more time.

- Implement state management solution (BLoC or Provider) to separate business logic from UI.
- Spend more time comparing different audio player plugins, and find the most suitable one.
- Test Song model conversion from raw JSON input.
- Test music player's different UI states when different song data is provided.
	- eg. Mock `songs` data with two songs in it, and make sure expected information are there.
	- Mock the API call with various status code returned (200, 202, 400, 404....), and make sure the app handles errors correctly.
	- Break search bar and songs list into two different files, similar to what I did to `MusicController`.
